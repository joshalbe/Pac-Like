Artificial Intelligence Assessment Post-Mortem

Agents:
-Ghost
An agent that chases the player
I would have liked it to kinda play tag with the player, persuing them when they're far and evading them when
they're close.
Unfortunately, only the persuing behavior really stuck due to so many issues with pathfinding.

Behaviors:
-EvadePathBehavior
Ideally this would bring the Ghost away from the player. In the end, however, I didn't get the chance to implement
it into the decision tree.
-PursuePathBehavior
It was supposed to follow the player along an ideal path according to the pathfinding algorithm, but ended up taking
longer than expected. It does pursue the player now, though.
